# Multi-axis Cross-covariance Attention for Deformable Medical Image Registration
Deformable image registration, aiming to establish a pixel-wise non-linear spatial correspondence between images, is a fundamental step in medical image analysis. Transformers have been widely used in deep learning-based registration methods for the ability to capture long-range dependencies. However, the high computation/memory loads of self-attention hinder transformers from processing subtle textural infor-mation in high-resolution image features, e.g., at the full/half image resolutions. This limits deformable registration as high-resolution textural information is crucial for finding precise pixel-wise correspondence between subtle anatomical struc-tures. Cross-covariance Attention (XCA), operating across feature channels, has complexity growing linearly with spatial resolution, providing the feasibility of capturing long-range dependencies among high-resolution image features. Unfortu-nately, existing XCA-based models merely capture coarse global dependencies, which are unsuitable for deformable reg-istration tasks relying primarily on fine-grained local corre-spondence. In this study, we propose to enhance existing deep learning-based registration methods by embedding a new XCA mechanism. To this end, we design an XCA-based transformer block optimized for deformable image registration, named Multi-Axis XCA (MAXCA). MAXCA serves as a general net-work block that can be embedded into various registration net-work architectures. It captures both global and local long-range dependencies among high-resolution image features by applying regional and dilated XCA in parallel via a multi-axis design. Extensive experiments on two well-benchmarked inter-/intra-patient registration tasks with seven public medical im-age datasets demonstrate that our method enables state-of-the-art registration performance.
